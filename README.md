# Contribution Guide
### Fork The Repo
* Navigate to the Spoon-Knife project at [https://github.com/zuri-training/Proj_qr_gen_team_58](https://github.com/zuri-training/Proj_qr_gen_team_58)
* Click on the fork button
* Confirm that the owner name is yours and name of the name of the project matches the original. Optionally, you can add a description to your fork.
* Copy the default main branch
* Click create fork.

### Clone The Repo
* Navigate to your fork of the repository
* Click on **Code** .
* Copy the URL for the repository.
    To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click on the copy button.
* Open git bash
* Cd into the directory you want to clone your project
* Use the command `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Proj_qr_gen_team_58` and press enter.

### Configuring Git To Sync Your Fork With The Original Repository
* Use command `git remote -v` and press enter to view the configured remote repository of your fork.
* Add the parent repo using command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/Proj_qr_gen_team_58.git`, then press enter.
* To verify the new upstream, use command `git remote -v` again and press enter. You should see your fork as the origin url and original repo as the upstream url:
```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Proj_qr_gen_team_58.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Proj_qr_gen_team_58.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/zuri-training/Proj_qr_gen_team_58.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/zuri-training/Proj_qr_gen_team_58.git (push)

```

### Creating Your Branch
* Once you have successfully forked and cloned the repo on your local, cd into the project folder using  `cd Proj_qr_gen_team_58`.
* Use command `git branch` to see the branches available.
* Use command `git checkout -b branch_name` to create your new branch that you would be working on. If you already have a branch, use command `git checkout branch_name`.
Now you can go ahead and make changes on your branch to thereafter send a pull request to be reviewed and merged with the main branch.

### Syncing Forked Branch To Get Latest Code
* Use command `git pull upstream main` else if stated that there is a dev branch, then use `git pull upstream branch-name`.

### Pushing Your Code And Sending Pull Requests
* Before you begin working on your branch, always ensure to pull upstream to get latest code update and avoid merge conflict.
 Tip ðŸ’¡: You can check the branch you are working on using `git branch`
* Once you are done coding, stage your changes using `git add`.
* Then commit your changes your local branch: `git commit -m 'your reason for adding the code'`.
 Tip ðŸ’¡: You can check the files yet to be staged and committed using `git status`.
* Check the parent repo if there has been any update since your recent pull to avoid conflicts and have a work that is in sync by pulling from the parent repo again using command `git pull upstream main` (except otherwise stated that there is a dev branch, then use `git pull upstream branch-name`)
* Once the pull is completed without any conflicts, push your changes to your own repo using `git push origin branch-name`.
* Go to your repo, click on make contributions (if create a pull request doesn't show up) and create a pull request.
* Compare parent development branch with your own development branch and create a pull request
